# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Users can watch an anime song and understand exactly what every word means — with furigana, translation, grammar breakdown, and vocabulary categorization synced to the music as it plays.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Phase 08.1 — End-to-End QA Suite (in progress, plan 3/8 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 08.1 of 11 (End-to-End QA Suite)
Plan: 3 of 8 in current phase complete; next: 08.1-04
Status: Plan 08.1-03 complete (integration layer — 4 test files, 16 tests covering jlpt-pool API, admin songs API, saveSessionResults upsert semantics, queries.ts read-time star derivation + information_schema invariant; setupFiles redirects DATABASE_URL → TEST_DATABASE_URL; suite skips cleanly when env unset, runs in <30s when provisioned)
Last activity: 2026-04-17 — Plan 08.1-03 complete (3 commits ae96508, 67a1853, 7cc0d81; tests authored hermetically with describe.skip guards; pending env: TEST_DATABASE_URL still required for plans 03/06/07 to actually exercise assertions).

Progress: [████░░░░░░░░] v1.0 Phase 1 in progress (6/8 plans); v2.0 Phase 08.1 in progress (3/8 plans)

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 08.1 inserted after Phase 8: End-to-End QA Suite (URGENT) — cross-cutting Playwright + Node-side QA infra to verify v1.0 player + v2.0 Phase 8 exercise engine before Phase 9 (Kana Trainer) builds further
- Phase 08.2 inserted after Phase 8: FSRS progressive disclosure (URGENT) — wire user_vocab_mastery/user_exercise_log writes (currently dead infra) and derive a per-word display tier (kanji+furigana+romaji → kanji+furigana → kanji only) so exercise options stop starting at bare kanji; also unblocks Phase 11's assumption that per-vocab mastery is being persisted
- Phase 08.3 inserted after Phase 8: Mnemonic and kanji breakdown for vocabulary feedback — extend VocabEntry with `mnemonic` + `kanji_breakdown` fields, update content-generation prompt in scripts/seed/03-generate-content.ts, backfill ~60 songs (~1200 vocab items), surface in FeedbackPanel "More" accordion. Separated from Phase 8 refactor (which landed vocab block + wrong-pick callout + verse context without re-seed).

### Decisions

- Foundation: Use YouTube iframe embed API (not audio extraction) — legal compliance
- Foundation: Pre-generate all lesson content offline via Claude API before launch
- Foundation: Freemium gating at database layer (not hidden UI elements)
- 01-01: JSONB for lesson content (not normalized tables)
- v2.0: Vocabulary identity tracked by UUID FK to vocabulary_items (not surface string) — avoids progress orphaning on content corrections
- v2.0: Exercise generation is client-side from existing JSONB — no pre-computation pipeline needed
- v2.0: FSRS columns as individual scalar columns (not JSONB) — required for indexed due-date queries
- v2.0: Phase 9 (Kana Trainer) can be built in parallel with Phase 8 (Exercise Engine)
- 07-01: Materialized view refresh on song update (not cron) via refreshVocabGlobal() with CONCURRENTLY fallback
- 07-01: Migration written manually — drizzle-kit generate interactive due to unregistered 0001 migration in journal
- [Phase 07-02]: parseConjugationPath called on-demand at exercise time, no JSONB mutation for grammar points
- [Phase 07-02]: Full vocabulary_items table scan for UUID resolution avoids large parameterized IN clauses
- [Phase 08-01]: Stars derived at read time via deriveStars() — never stored as a DB column
- [Phase 08-01]: checkExerciseAccess() is single gate — UI never checks feature flags directly
- [Phase 08-01]: All 4 Phase 8 exercise types declared free — no subscription lookup needed for MVP
- [Phase 08-02]: Generator is pure TypeScript (no DB/network) — enables isolated vitest testing without mocking
- [Phase 08-02]: fill_lyric disabled when < 3 vocab entries in song (can't form 4 unique options)
- [Phase 08-02]: Distractor dedup uses trim+lowercase normalization to prevent synonym collisions
- [Phase 08-03]: isSessionForSong guards against stale cross-song sessions in ExerciseTab
- [Phase 08-03]: Exercise bundle lazy-loaded via React.lazy — keeps initial song page fast
- [Phase 08.1-01]: QA test DB strategy — dedicated TEST_DATABASE_URL on the same Neon project (not ephemeral, not dev DB with test users)
- [Phase 08.1-01]: TEST_USER_ID constant 'test-user-e2e' — single string used everywhere; seedTestUser() seam reserved for Clerk auth
- [Phase 08.1-01]: SEEDED_SLUGS = again-yui + red-swan-yoshiki-feat-hyde + mayonaka-no-orchestra-aqua-timez (last is geo-restricted for plan 08.1-07 regression)
- [Phase 08.1-01]: Zero-flake policy enforced at playwright.config.ts (retries:0, single line) — plan 08.1-08 audits via grep
- [Phase 08.1-01]: Custom plain-ASCII Playwright Reporter — terminal-first; HTML report opt-in via `npm run test:report`
- [Phase 08.1-01]: test:all chains test:seed FIRST so the suite aborts early on stale catalog (saves the 15-min budget)
- [Phase 08.1-02]: Determinism test asserts length-stability + per-type bounds (not exact ordering) — Fisher-Yates shuffle is unseeded today; tightens automatically when generator gains a seeded shuffle
- [Phase 08.1-02]: Thin-pool 3-distractor invariant encoded as `it.fails` (not deleted) — flips RED automatically the moment generator gains a fallback for empty JLPT pool
- [Phase 08.1-02]: Access tests derive FREE/PREMIUM lists programmatically from EXERCISE_FEATURE_FLAGS — no test edits needed when Phase 10 adds premium types
- [Phase 08.1-02]: deriveStars test imports from @/lib/db/schema (not @/lib/db/index) — preserves the no-DB-in-unit-layer invariant for plan 08.1-08 grep audit
- [Phase 08.1-03]: Single global setupFiles entry (tests/integration/setup.ts) instead of vitest projects — loads .env.test/.env.local and redirects DATABASE_URL → TEST_DATABASE_URL before any DB-touching import resolves; safe for unit tests since they don't read DATABASE_URL
- [Phase 08.1-03]: Per-file describe.skip guard when TEST_DATABASE_URL is unset — keeps `npm run test:integration` green pre-provisioning instead of failing at import time
- [Phase 08.1-03]: information_schema invariant test asserts `user_song_progress` has NO `stars` column — locks the read-time star derivation decision at the schema level; a future refactor that adds the column will fail this test loudly
- [Phase 08.1-03]: Direct route handler invocation in integration tests (`import { GET } from "@/app/.../route"` + `new NextRequest`) — no Next.js dev server, ~3s faster per run, exercises the same handler the framework would invoke
- [Phase 08.1-03]: Defensive `Array.isArray(raw) ? raw : (raw.rows ?? [])` pattern for drizzle .execute(sql) — neon-http return shape varies by query and silently masks failures otherwise

### Pending Todos

- [Enforce full Japanese-line coverage in lesson prompt](todos/pending/2026-04-16-enforce-full-japanese-line-coverage-in-lesson-prompt.md) — tooling — lesson prompt skips filler Japanese lines (~30s stale highlight on sign-flow; likely systemic)
- [Replace 19 remaining geo-restricted YouTube videos](todos/pending/2026-04-16-replace-19-remaining-geo-restricted-youtube-videos.md) — tooling — `npm run audit:geo:replace` hit quota after 2/21; run again after quota reset (~2000 units needed)
- [Label song page sections so lesson is discoverable](todos/pending/2026-04-16-label-song-page-sections-so-lesson-is-discoverable.md) — ui — song page has no "Lesson" label; users think lesson is missing (surfaced QAing Sign 2026-04-16)
- [Amend bogus "--help" commit message on 3109fcf](todos/pending/2026-04-16-amend-bogus-help-commit-message.md) — tooling — commit 3109fcf has literal message "--help" (CLI mis-parse); content is harmless Phase 7 doc cleanup, just needs message reword while still local

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Lyric copyright strategy requires legal review for US and Japan markets
- Phase 1: Pipeline execution blocked pending env setup: YOUTUBE_API_KEY, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- v2.0 Phase 7: [RESOLVED] Conjugation audit complete — 91% structured, 9% unstructured (pattern labels). Exercise eligibility filter now well-defined.
- v2.0 Phase 8: Distractor pool is thin until 30+ songs are seeded — validateDistractorPool() fallback to same-JLPT-level words needed
- Phase 08.1-01: TEST_DATABASE_URL not yet provisioned — operator must create separate Neon DB, run `npm run seed:dev` against it, and `npm run test:seed` before plans 08.1-03 / 08.1-06 / 08.1-07 execute (plans 02 and 04 are pure unit/script and can run without).
- Phase 08.1-03: 16 new integration tests are authored but currently SKIPPED end-to-end — operator must complete TEST_DATABASE_URL provisioning (create DB, db:push migrations, npm run seed:dev, npm run test:seed) for them to actually exercise assertions. Suite is hermetic and will activate automatically once env is set; no test code change needed.
