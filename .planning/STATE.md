# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Users can watch an anime song and understand exactly what every word means — with furigana, translation, grammar breakdown, and vocabulary categorization synced to the music as it plays.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Phase 8 — Exercise Engine (in progress)

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 12 (Exercise Engine)
Plan: 3 of 7 in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-04-16 — Plan 08-03 complete (exercise session UI: Zustand store, JLPT pool API, ExerciseTab/Session/QuestionCard/FeedbackPanel, Practice tab in SongContent)

Progress: [████░░░░░░░░] v1.0 Phase 1 in progress (6/8 plans); v2.0 not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 10 min
- Total execution time: 0.8 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-content-pipeline | 6/8 | 60 min | 10 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 6 plans: 01-01 (13 min), 01-02 (6 min), 01-03 (4 min), 01-04 (7 min), 01-05 (22 min), 01-07 (8 min)
- Trend: stable

| Phase 08-exercise-engine P03 | 5 | 3 tasks | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Foundation: Use YouTube iframe embed API (not audio extraction) — legal compliance
- Foundation: Pre-generate all lesson content offline via Claude API before launch
- Foundation: Freemium gating at database layer (not hidden UI elements)
- 01-01: JSONB for lesson content (not normalized tables)
- v2.0: Vocabulary identity tracked by UUID FK to vocabulary_items (not surface string) — avoids progress orphaning on content corrections
- v2.0: Exercise generation is client-side from existing JSONB — no pre-computation pipeline needed
- v2.0: FSRS columns as individual scalar columns (not JSONB) — required for indexed due-date queries
- v2.0: Phase 9 (Kana Trainer) can be built in parallel with Phase 8 (Exercise Engine)
- 07-01: Materialized view refresh on song update (not cron) via refreshVocabGlobal() with CONCURRENTLY fallback
- 07-01: Migration written manually — drizzle-kit generate interactive due to unregistered 0001 migration in journal
- [Phase 07-02]: parseConjugationPath called on-demand at exercise time, no JSONB mutation for grammar points
- [Phase 07-02]: Full vocabulary_items table scan for UUID resolution avoids large parameterized IN clauses
- [Phase 08-01]: Stars derived at read time via deriveStars() — never stored as a DB column
- [Phase 08-01]: checkExerciseAccess() is single gate — UI never checks feature flags directly
- [Phase 08-01]: All 4 Phase 8 exercise types declared free — no subscription lookup needed for MVP
- [Phase 08-02]: Generator is pure TypeScript (no DB/network) — enables isolated vitest testing without mocking
- [Phase 08-02]: fill_lyric disabled when < 3 vocab entries in song (can't form 4 unique options)
- [Phase 08-02]: Distractor dedup uses trim+lowercase normalization to prevent synonym collisions
- [Phase 08-03]: isSessionForSong guards against stale cross-song sessions in ExerciseTab
- [Phase 08-03]: Exercise bundle lazy-loaded via React.lazy — keeps initial song page fast

### Pending Todos

- [Enforce full Japanese-line coverage in lesson prompt](todos/pending/2026-04-16-enforce-full-japanese-line-coverage-in-lesson-prompt.md) — tooling — lesson prompt skips filler Japanese lines (~30s stale highlight on sign-flow; likely systemic)
- [Replace 19 remaining geo-restricted YouTube videos](todos/pending/2026-04-16-replace-19-remaining-geo-restricted-youtube-videos.md) — tooling — `npm run audit:geo:replace` hit quota after 2/21; run again after quota reset (~2000 units needed)
- [Label song page sections so lesson is discoverable](todos/pending/2026-04-16-label-song-page-sections-so-lesson-is-discoverable.md) — ui — song page has no "Lesson" label; users think lesson is missing (surfaced QAing Sign 2026-04-16)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Lyric copyright strategy requires legal review for US and Japan markets
- Phase 1: Pipeline execution blocked pending env setup: YOUTUBE_API_KEY, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- v2.0 Phase 7: [RESOLVED] Conjugation audit complete — 91% structured, 9% unstructured (pattern labels). Exercise eligibility filter now well-defined.
- v2.0 Phase 8: Distractor pool is thin until 30+ songs are seeded — validateDistractorPool() fallback to same-JLPT-level words needed
